Part of the GA SEI Course and Project 1, produce a version of the ol'school game Tic Tac Toe



## Link to game

[To Play the Game](https://yuanndiego.github.io/Super-Pretendo---TicTacToe/)

## 1. Explanations of the Technologies and Support Material
 - UI toolkit - NES CSS Framework - https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/
 - HTML, CSS, Javascript
 - Planned to use animate.css

## 2. The approach taken
 -Played a few TTT games online and researched problem.
 -Finalised a theme, as this may play on the user flows etc. 
 -Quick notepad with wireframes.
 -Drafted a rough storyboard in figma 
        - documented all the advanced features that would be nice to have. -------> 
 -Marked up high level features for coding. Complete logistic first with basic HTML/CSS markup. 
 -After main logic (ex draw feature) was completed, commenced theming (given only 1 day left). 

## 3. Installation instructions
None- just start playing by clicking 'Let's Play'.

## 4. Unsolved problems, bugs etc.

Bugs
- winstates 2,4,6 boxes on player 2. 
- winstates 1,4,7 boxes on player 2
- winstates 0,4,8 boxes on player 1 - when all the boxes are filled. 
- game seems slow.

Other unsolved problems
- Producing a draw game/outcome
- Stop game after win (hope to do this with congratulations modal box).
- show trophy picture instead of highlighting winning move. 

## 5. Additional requirements

Coding  
- Modal boxes - 1. congrat overall game winner; 2. spot is taken. 
- Option to play computer (ie 1 player).
- Option to select characters. 
- remove 'let's start' functionality  (hope to get rid of this with additional pages in storyboard). 
- we probably need new data structure? 

Frontend
- to get the pages to look very similar to the mock up :(

Additional experiences
- Pages, as per initial storyboard in figma. 
- add soundbites

## 6. How is my version unique? 
Its probably not :)
